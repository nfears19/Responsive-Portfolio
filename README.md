# Responsive-Portfolio-N.Fears
# Description

This repository contains my portfolio website. This project was a homework assignment from the Case Western Reserve Univeristy's Coding Bootcamp.
The portfolio website was created using the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio and minimize the use of media queries.
